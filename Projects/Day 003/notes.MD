# Day 3 notes 100 days of code.

day 3 we are working on else if staements in the first video

```python
print("welcome to the rollercoaster!")
height = int(input("what is your hieght in cm? "))

if height >= 120: ## (if the height is greater than or equal to 120cm)
    print("you can ride the rollercoater")
## indentation is important with if else statements. The else is a pair with if so the indentation
## needs to be the same
else: ## if the input is less than 120 we will get this else statement
    print("Sorry, you have to grow taller before you can ride.")
```
