### Day 2: January 12, 2023

Todays progress: As I was going through day 1 and now day 2 I decided im going to create a notes.py file to go through the concepts of the day and including that in each day. I worked through all the video and practice coding I found that I get the results but my code is not efficient. There are to many steps to get the outcome.

### Day 3: January 14, 2023

Todays progress: the 3rd day took me a bit of time to get done it had a good bit of knowledge and challenging exercises you had to think through the solution and test a lot. overall it was great fun and the final project was great and allowed you some creativity.

### Day 4: January 14, 2023

Today progress: the 4th day was a lot of fun I went over randomization and list and some cases of how to use them. with these 2 topic I feel like there is so much more you can do with them and I barely scratched the surface. The final project was a ton of fun you get to build a childhood game and figure out the logic to make it work on the computer.
