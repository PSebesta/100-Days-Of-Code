# 100 Days Of Code - Daily Log

### Day 1: January 11, 2023

Todays Progress: Today was not to bad I got familiar with the course and materials. The core topics of day one was print, strings, input function, and variables with each topic there where interactive excersise to help reatain the knowlege. all of these topics build on themselves to lead to the final project of the "band name generator"

### Day 2: January 12, 2023

Todays progress: As I was going through day 1 and now day 2 I decided im going to create a notes.py file to go through the concepts of the day and including that in each day. I worked through all the video and practice coding I found that I get the results but my code is not efficient. There are to many steps to get the outcome.

### Day 3: January 14, 2023

Todays progress: the 3rd day took me a bit of time to get done it had a good bit of knowledge and challenging exercises you had to think through the solution and test a lot. overall it was great fun and the final project was great and allowed you some creativity.

### Day 4: January 18, 2023

Today progress: the 4th day was a lot of fun I went over randomization and list and some cases of how to use them. with these 2 topic I feel like there is so much more you can do with them and I barely scratched the surface. The final project was a ton of fun you get to build a childhood game and figure out the logic to make it work on the computer.

### Day 5: January 19, 2023

Today progress: I have completed the 5th day project. Today I learned about loops and range functions the basic concepts were not to bad to learn but, just like yesterday when I said we are barley scratching the surface of what you can do with them. Over it was fun and I enjoyed all the coding in this block.

### Day 6: January 20, 2023

Today progress: I have completed the 6th day training and project. This day you dont use the traditional IDE and you use the reborgs world game. It was actually a lot of fun and there are more games than angela goes over in the training. The final project was challenging but very simple from the coding side of it (not al ot of code to use)
