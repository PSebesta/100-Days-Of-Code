# About
I wanted to challenge myself by learning a coding language and I stumbled on Angela Yu's 100 Days of Python Pro Bootcamp. What I enjoyed about this course hwen I was reasearching it is the project based approach to learning python. The challenge is simple I will need to code for at least an hour a day and I will be uploadng my progess and final projects for each day.

If you would like to follow along on my journey I will be posting daily update on my social media platforms and my website. The links are on github profile page :D
