# Rules for the 100 Days Of Code Challenge

## My Commitment

### I will code for at least one hour a day for the next 100 days

### Start Date

January 11th, 2023

## My Personal Rules

    1. I will update my progress everyday using my daily log file, social media platforms and my personal website.
    2. If time allows I may do more challenges in one day, also as the topics and projects become more complex it may take more than a day to complete.
    3. I will push code to Github everyday so that anyone can see my progress one to keep me accountable and to learn from the community.
